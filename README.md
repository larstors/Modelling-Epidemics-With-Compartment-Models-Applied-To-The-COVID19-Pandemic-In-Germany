# Projektpraktikum SoSe 2021

This project looks at the impact commuting has had on the Covid-19 pandemic in the region around Göttingen, Germany, using a modified SIR model. This includes general analysis of how the parameters impact the system, but also which parameters are optimal so as to reproduce the data from Robert Koch-Institut (RKI).
